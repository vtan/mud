    You stand at a crossroad, surrounded by dense foliage.
    The air is still and quiet, except for the distant sound of birds singing in the trees.
    To the east, you see the ruins of an ancient temple, its pillars and walls overgrown with vines.
    To the north, a tall tower reaches towards the sky, its walls adorned with intricate carvings and strange symbols.
    To the south, you see the pointed fenceposts of a graveyard, obscured by the thick fog that seems to linger around the area.
